# webpack_poc_demo
A sample POC for using webpack

To use this project simply clone it and npm install to install the dependencies

Then type 'npm run build' in console.

For development you can use the dev server - which adds additional files to your build resulting in larger size
So, you can turn off the warning by setting the performance flag to false.

However, when you create your build using build command the size of the dist is very less as no addtional files
are added unike dev server.
